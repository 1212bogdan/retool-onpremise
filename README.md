## Deploy Self-Hosted Retool

Find deployment instructions in the [official deployment guides](https://docs.retool.com/docs/deploy-guide-overview) hosted on docs.retool.com. Retool officially supports the following deployment methods:


### Single deployments
  - [AWS w/ EC2](https://docs.retool.com/docs/deploy-with-aws-ec2)
  - [GCP w/ Compute Engine VM](https://docs.retool.com/docs/deploy-with-gcp)
  - [Azure w/ Azure VM](https://docs.retool.com/docs/deploy-with-azure-vm)
### Orchestrated deployments
  - [Kubernetes](https://docs.retool.com/docs/deploy-with-kubernetes)
  - [Kubernetes + Helm](https://docs.retool.com/docs/deploy-with-helm)
  - [ECS + Fargate](https://docs.retool.com/docs/deploy-with-ecs-fargate)


Some previously supported deployment methods, such as Heroku and Render, are no longer a good fit for production use. You can still access these instructions in [deprecated-onpremise](https://github.com/tryretool/deprecated-onpremise) repository.
